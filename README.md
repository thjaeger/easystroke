Easy Gesture is a gesture-recognition application for X11. Gestures or strokes are movements that you make with you mouse (or your pen, finger etc.) while holding down a specific mouse button. Easy Gesture will execute certain actions if it recognizes the stroke; currently Easy Gesture can emulate key presses, execute shell commands, hold down modifiers and emulate a scroll wheel. The program was designed with Tablet PCs in mind and can be used effectively even without access to a keyboard. Easy Gesture tries to provide an intuitive and efficient user interface, while at the same time being highly configurable and offering many advanced features.
